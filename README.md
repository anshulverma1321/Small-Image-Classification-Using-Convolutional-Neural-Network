# Small Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying small-sized images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNNs are highly effective for image-related tasks as they automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features through convolutional layers.

The project demonstrates the complete deep learning workflow including data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and result visualization.
