Problem Statement
Traditional machine learning models struggle with raw image data due to high dimensionality and spatial complexity. This project solves the problem by using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract meaningful features and classify small images efficiently.

Solution Overview
A CNN-based deep learning model is trained on a dataset of small images. The network uses convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers to learn hierarchical image features and predict class labels.
